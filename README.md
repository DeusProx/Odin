# History

In Norse mythology, Ratatoskr (Old Norse, generally considered to mean "drill-tooth" or "bore-tooth") is a squirrel who runs up and down the world tree Yggdrasil to carry messages between the eagle Vedrfölnir, perched atop Yggdrasil, and the dragon Nídhöggr, who dwells beneath one of the three roots of the tree.
